* Commands
** Android

   Run developer Android app (requires package manager running on developer machine)

   ~react-native run-android~

   Generate and run release variant. (Requires signing to be configured)

   ~react-native run-android --variant=release~

   Generate a signed APK. (Requires signing to be configured)

** iOS
* Troubleshooting
** Error: Error watching file for changes: EMFILE

   This happened on iOS when doing a react-native run-ios. I ended up doing a brew install watchman to fix this issue. I did try a few other things, like upping limits using various commands but they didn't seem to help.
